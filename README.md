Software designed for automating persistent search and scraping operations on Twitter, implemented using R programming language and the Twitter Developer API. The solution is optimized for Docker and Raspberry Pi environments, showcasing seamless automation in Twitter data retrieval.
<br/>
- Twitter Developer API poses a challenge due to limited access to past tweets (7-9 days) using R (rtweet) and Python (tweepy) libraries.
- A premium API subscription from Twitter allows extended search capabilities, covering 30 days or the entire archive since â‰… 2007.
- Developing an automated solution for efficient searching of tweets on the topic "basic income" amid other project tasks.
- Documenting the development journey and sharing the application for open contributions.
- Aim is to provide a user-friendly script for those less familiar with R or computational tools in humanities research.
